/*
If you plan on sharing your library crate so other projects can use your code,
your public API is your contract with users of your crate that determines how 
they can interact with your code. 
There are many considerations around managing changes to your public API to 
make it easier for people to depend on your crate. These considerations are 
out of the scope of this book; if youâ€™re interested in this topic, see The 
Rust API Guidelines (https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/).
